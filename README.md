# Little Brother

Little brother is a multiplayer word game you can play with friends


NOPE DON"T READ THIS LINE :microservices directory holds zeit node js functions (NO LONGER USING ZEIT/VERCEL BC THEY SUCK)

src holds vue app : get mongodb uri from self made config.yaml (contact Joshua Kang for this)

server directory holds the regular node server for socket.io websocket capabilities

Run "npm i" in microservices and server directory directory and in root directory

npm run dev in root to start vue app

now dev in microservices with necessary .env file to run database directory to start zeit backend service

Install blix for cool features
